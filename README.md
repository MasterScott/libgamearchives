# libgamearchives

A reimplementation of [GameArchives](https://github.com/maxton/GameArchives) in C++. The design at present is almost identical but I may end up changing it significantly if the C# idioms are too different from what makes sense in C++.

## Goals

Right now the goal is feature-parity with GameArchives, at least in terms of supported archives.

## FAQs

### Why remake GameArchives in C++?

I want to improve my C++ ability because I am using C++ almost exclusively at my new job. This seemed like a simple enough way to get some practice. I have very little experience with memory management for anything bigger than a few C files, and at that I only really understand how to do it with malloc/free.

### How do I use this library?

I'm not even sure about that yet. Wait for the code churn to subside once I've figured out the design better.
